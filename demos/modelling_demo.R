# Modelling Demo

# This file serves to demo the technique used for modelling data as a function of time, which
# we will employ to naively predict how values will change given time. This will then be the 
# basis of our neural network predictions.

# For this, we will use data from the World Bank, probably data we'll end up using for the 
# final project - be sure working directory is set to source file location.
gdp_data <- read.csv("../data/input/gdp_per_capita.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

# Selecting a random country for this analysis, reformatting the data.
data_vector <- as.numeric(as.vector(gdp_data[gdp_data$Country.Name == "Burundi", c(-1, -2, -3, -4)]))

select_data <- data.frame(gdp = data_vector, year = 1960:2017)

# Our model describes GDP as a function of year, which is based on our data for Burundi.
model <- lm(gdp ~ year, data = select_data)
