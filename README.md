# INFO 201 A Final Project

A repository for collaborating on the final project for INFO 201. Contains
several directories with resources for a shiny app, which is defined by the
ui.R and server.R scripts in the scripts directory. The scripts that contributed
to the data analysis will also be found in the scripts directory, and
demonstrations of the methods used in those scripts can be found in the demos
directory. The data used in this project will be found in the data directory,
which will contain a subdirectory "input", which has slightly modified csv files
that were the basis of our project, and an "output" subdirectory, which has a
number of csv files written by the data analysis scripts.
