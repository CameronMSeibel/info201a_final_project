way to development. We consider a country's wealth and life expectancies and use machine learning 
to identify and estimate its development. In our analysis we map the global distribution of wealth 
to reveal trends in geography and speed of development. The projections show a continuing uneven 
    distribution of wealth, with the countries nearest to other developed countries developing the fastest."
